#### About myself:
I&nbsp;am an&nbsp;art historian whose scholar interest lies in&nbsp;the XXth century art, modernism and specificly the art excluded from art historian studies because of&nbsp;the censorship in&nbsp;the USSR period.


My&nbsp;engagement with&nbsp;IT started from the deep understanding that the humanitarian studies had a&nbsp;vital need in&nbsp;them. Technologies for visual and big data analyses, digitalization of&nbsp;archives&nbsp;&mdash; these all can make academic research worldwide accessible and significatly more prolific.


After one and half a&nbsp;year of&nbsp;studying Java Script I&nbsp;dived deep into the world of&nbsp;programming and got absolutely convinced that it&nbsp;was not just a&nbsp;tool for the other fields but the basis of&nbsp;the future.
