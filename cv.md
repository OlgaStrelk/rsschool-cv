## About myself:
I am an art historian whose scholar interest lies in the XXth century art, modernism and specificly the art excluded from art historian studies because of the censorship in the USSR period.


My engagement with IT started from the deep understanding that the humanitarian studies had a vital need in them. Technologies for visual and big data analyses, digitalization of archives - these all can make academic research worldwide accessible and significatly more prolific.


After one and half a year of studying Java Script I dived deep into the world of programming and got absolutely convinced that it was not just a tool for the other fields but the basis of the future.
