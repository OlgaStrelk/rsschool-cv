## About myself:
I am art historian which scholar interest lies in the XXth century art, modernism and specificly the art excluded from art historian studies because of the censorship in the USSR period.


My engagement with IT started from the deep understanding that the humanitarian studies had a vital need in them. Technoligies for visual and big data analyses, dizitalization of archives - these all can make the academic research worldwide accessible and significatly more prolific.


After one and half a year of studying Java Script I dived deep into the world of programming and absolutely convinced that it is not just a tool for the other fields but the basis of the future.
